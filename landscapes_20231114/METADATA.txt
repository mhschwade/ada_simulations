Spatial extent: 
   Theoretical landscape. A square landscape with not habitable sites detemined 
   by landscape cost. A landscape of 30x30 (900) sites. Latitude [0, -30], 
   Longitude [-15, 15]

Spatial resolution: 
   1 gr (theoretical)

Temporal extent: 
   10000 timesteps (generations). This landscape is fixed at time.

Temporal resolution: 
   1 timestep ~ 1 generation (all original individuals in a site die at the next 
   timestep, but it is determined by the ecological dynamics in config file of 
   the gen3sis simulations, not by the landscape per se)

Environmental variables: 
   cond1;
   cond2

Cost function: 
   cost_function_hab:
           - 1 habitable site
           - 2 not habitable site

Source Data: 
   Fictional data generated using `script_to_run_create_simple_landscape2.R` and
   the landscape cost file `landscape_cost.txt`

Description: 
    This landscape was originally named simple_landscape_20231114 and used to 
    simulate data for test the ADA method for ancestor area reconstruction.
    The not habitable sites are determined by the user to form a set of 3 extent
    barriers across the landscape.
