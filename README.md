# ada_simulations

This repository contains codes and scripts to config and run simulations of eco-evolutionary scenarios over a landscape using the gen3sis package. This data will be usedd to test and compare some methods for species ancestor area reconstruction used in Ecology and Evolution.

Read the file 'instrucoes.txt' (in Portuguese) for more details about how to run the simulations.

At this moment, this repository contains only information to run neutral simulations. In future I will add information to extract and proccess the results of the simulations and also to simulate the same system using ecological dynamics with niche-environment interaction.
